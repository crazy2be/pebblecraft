miniGL ChangeLog

v0.1:

Initial source release.  Includes most basic gl rendering fucntions.
At least enough to render a cube on the screen.

v0.2:

Added double-buffering support and a glutSwapBuffers() call.  Added 
glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE) support to cull backfacing polys.  Added initial 
greyscale support.  Lighting model support and initial calls to 
glLightfv(...) to add up to 8 lights.

v0.4a:

Changed to shared lib.  Only need the following files for compiling the
lib now:

	miniGL.h
	minigl_main.{c,h}
	fastmath.{c,h}
	fastgraph.{c,h}

The miniGL.h file should be included in any app that is to use miniGL,
and the libminigl.sa shared lib should be linked in.

v0.4b (10.19.00): 

Changed to a REAL shared lib, a la MathLib.  You should use the 
miniGL.h and miniGL.c files compiled into your own app that is
to use miniGL, then install your app and the miniGLLib.prc file
onto the Palm device.  This is a new and better way of doing
shared libs.  Trust me.
