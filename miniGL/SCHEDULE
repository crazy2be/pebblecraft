miniGL v0.3 Build Schedule
http://www.dsbox.com/minigl.html

March 5-11:

	Integrate new math functions to avoid linking to MathLib external
	library.  Use new implementations of sin(), cos(), atan(), and
	sqrt().  

	Add specular component to illumination model.  Support GL_SPECULAR
	token in glLightfv(...) to set light color and specular exponent.

	Clean up floodfill routine to get rid of slope rounding error when
	m is shallow in y direction.

	Add support for all 8 lights instead of just for GL_LIGHT0 as in the
	current hack.

	Tie in GL_FLAT to actually be set by glShadeModel() call, with 
	GL_SMOOTH not supported at this time until Phong shading is 
	implemented.

	glMaterialfv(...) implemented and used with lighting model.

	Z-buffer implementation used during floodfill routine to draw 
	overlapping polygons.  Note:  memory hog.  Perhaps implement
	only a scan line Z-buffer at constant screen y.

	v0.3 release on March 11, 2000.

October 2000:

	v0.4b release on 10.19.00.

	Plan to test with a more robust test rig beyond just a cube
	or simple primitive.  Need to get things working smoothly.
	Stability is the key this month...
