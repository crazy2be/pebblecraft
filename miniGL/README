INTRODUCTION
------------

The goal of the miniGL project is to allow for easy porting of 3D
OpenGL code to the Palm platform. While the color-rendering abilities
of the Palm OS are limited, the general geometry transformations and
wireframe rendering functions are to be supported. The miniGL library
seeks to achieve full OpenGL 1.1 compatibility (at least in the sense
that you can compile it; many functions will simply be stubs due to
Palm limitations). There is one supplied function external to the
GL-spec which specifies where in the 160x160 Palm window you
desire the rendering context to appear (WinSetGLArea), so you can
have the GL window within a larger form layout.

Please see http://www.dsbox.com/minigl.html for more information and 
updates, as well as the test rig program.  Source and release can be
obtained on the project page at http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=3404
